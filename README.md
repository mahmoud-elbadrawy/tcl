## 🔎 Overview

This repo is structured so learners can quickly run and explore Tcl scripts. Keep files small, include expected output for examples, and use clear filenames.

## 📁 Repository structure

- `notes.tcl` — general notes and useful snippets
- `lessons/` — concise lesson documents (`.md` or `.tcl`)
- `examples/` — runnable example scripts and demonstrations
- `README.md` — this file


## 🚀 Quick start

Prerequisites:
- Tcl installed (e.g., `tclsh`)

Run an example:

```bash
# run an example script with the Tcl interpreter
tclsh examples/example-01-hello-world.tcl
```

Each example should include a brief header comment explaining purpose and expected output.

## 🧩 Example conventions

- `example-01-*.tcl` — small, self-contained scripts
- Include an `# Usage:` comment at the top when needed
- Add expected output as comments or a separate `README` inside `examples/`
